## Description

I want to be the very best... at react.  Bad joke? I have more.

The purpose of this project was to utilize React props to complete the following tasks:* The App should render a single Pokegame
* Pokegame should take a list of 8 pokemon an randomly assign them into two hands of 4 cards each (repeats ok for now)
* Pokegame should calculate the the total experience for each hand and declare a winner/loser
* Pokecard should display the pokemon's name, type, image, and base experience
* The Pokecard image requires a function to push 0's in front of the pokemon id with one or two digits (4 -> 004, 35 -> 035, 109 -> 109)
